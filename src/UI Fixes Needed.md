# Future UI Bug Fixes for AG Grid Custom Theme Prototype

This document outlines the planned UI bug fixes for the AG Grid custom theme prototype.

## 1. Toolpanel Tab Underline Position

- **Issue**: The `sideButtonSelectedUnderlineColor: '#005999'` currently appears on the **left side** of the tab in the left side toolpanel.
- **Fix**: Update the styling to move the underline to the **right side** of the tab to align with design specifications.

## 2. Actions Column Visibility

- **Issue**: The **Actions** column is currently visible in the left side toolpanel.
- **Fix**: The Actions column should be **hidden or suppressed** in the left toolpanel to avoid unnecessary clutter and improve usability.

## 3. Input Field Focus State

- **Issue**: When double-clicking in a cell, the input field shows a **gray** focus state.
- **Fix**: Change the focus state color of input fields to a **brighter blue color `#0A99FF`** to enhance visibility and maintain consistency with the theme.

These fixes aim to improve the user experience and visual consistency of the AG Grid Figma theme.
